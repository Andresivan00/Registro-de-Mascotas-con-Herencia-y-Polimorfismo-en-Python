### Pet Registry with Inheritance and Polymorphism

* Base class `Pet` (intentionally incomplete to teach concepts)
* Classes `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Pet`
* Specialized subclasses:

  * Dogs: Small / Medium / Large (based on weight)
  * Cats: Hairless / Long-haired / Short-haired
* The program asks the user which type of pet they want to register
* Automatically classifies the pet based on the entered data
* Displays the pet’s personalized information using `__str__`
