# Pet Registry with Inheritance and Polymorphism

Educational interactive program that allows registering **dogs** or **cats** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with multiple inheritance and polymorphism.

### What this code does
- Base class `Pet` (intentionally incomplete to teach concepts)
- Classes `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Pet`
- Specialized subclasses:
  - Dogs: Small / Medium / Large (based on weight)
  - Cats: Hairless / Long-haired / Short-haired
- The program asks the user which type of pet they want to register
- Automatically classifies the pet based on the entered data
- Displays the pet’s personalized information using `__str__`
